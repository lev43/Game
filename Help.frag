// Don't you just love it when coders reuse the same algorthms that have been around of years, rearrange them a little, change the variable names,
// then attach one those threatening, copyright preambles to their work. I've seen copyright notices tagged onto ten-line plasma demos. Hilarious.
// Some coders definitely need to lay off the fairy dust, that's for sure.
//
// All of the code on this page has been written a gazillion u_times by a zillion different people. There is nothing new here. I guess that's why
// I've called it a template - because it's a relative cliche of a basic WebGL raymarching pipeline. Screen coordinates, camera setup, ray setup, raymarch,
// lighting, screen render, and done. Use it for whatever you purpose you like.
//
// Anyway, I'm genuinely grateful for all the code various people have made public over at "Shadertoy.com," which is run by that RGBA guy, Inigo Quilez,
// aka IQ. "Shader Toy" is an apt description for that site, because as a person who loves graphic-related snippets, I'm like a kid in a toy store
// over there. I guess you needed to have been on the net 15, or even 10, years ago trying to hunt down demo effects code to really appreciate what's
// being offered at "ShaderToy.com." Fantastic stuff.

// Larger numbers can give rounder looking corners, and can even take away a little aliasing, someu_times. However, larger numbers are obviously less
// accurate, and can make the edges appear lighter, darker, etc, than they should... It all depends on what you're looking to acheive.

// balance is almost an artform. In this particular example, not much is being done, so I've treated myself. Normally, I'd probably have to make do
// with 64 iterations, a step-scale of 0.75, and a higher stop-threshold, which has a tendency to smoothen off surface features when you don't want
// it to. Computers either need to get faster, or I need to become a better coder...  but since the latter's not going to happen, I'm counting on SGI
// and 3dfx to make it happen. I've been away for a while. They're still the best graphics card makers around, right?

// looking for points in 3d space where the isosurface equation below is close to zero. The easiest way to see whether the function below works is
// to picture a 1 unit radius sphere centered on the origin, which would mean (length(p) - 1 = 0), which expanded, rearranged, etc, gives:
// (x*x + y*y + z*z = 1).
//
// Therefore, you'd expect surface points (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1, 0), etc, to all return hits, which they do. Sure, I might be stating the
// obvious to some, but the entire concept of raymarching is based on evaluating isosurface functions, so someu_times it helps to plug in some real-world

// WTF has this clown done here? Good question. A smooth spherical surface doesn't really do raymarching enough justice, so I've added some cheap bumps.
// A sphere is easy to raytrace, and raymarch for that matter. The function below can be raytraced, but is only "easy" to do in a raymarching setting.
// The term "cheap" is relative, of course. A sinusoidal function tends to be a CPU killer, whereas the GPU seems to take it in its stride.
//
// Anyway, A*sin(f*p.x)*sin(f*p.y)*sin(f*p.z) - "f" for frequency and "A" for amplitude - is just one of the ways to put bumps on a sphere. I've also
// added an extra term with half the amplitude and twice the frequency for a little more detail. Yes, smooth noise, Voronoi, etc, would be more
// interesting, but this is just a simple template. The "u_time" term moves the bumps around a little, which gives the object a bit of movement and gives
// the specular lighting a better chance to shine... See what I did there? I also could have gone with a corny "in the spotlight" analogy.

// I often wonder who first came up with the idea to iteratively sample an object's isosurface description along a ray to get a hit point. Very clever,
// and elegant too. Don't make the mistake I made and try to overthink it. The idea really is pretty simple, but is kind of difficult to put into words.
//
// In essense, a point is inched incrementally along a ray through the scene and tested against a distance-field equation, which gives the distance to the
// closest surface point. When a point along the ray is within a threshold close enough to a surface, the surface point is returned, after which it's passed
// down the pipeline to be lit and rendered to the screen.

// Take a point along the ray and plug it into the scene equation. That equation will give the distance from the ray-point to the closest surface
// point in the scene. Obviously, if the distance returned is close to zero, then the ray point is at the surface object. If it's not, then you have to
// move further along the ray, and try again. Fair enough, but the question is, how far do you move along the ray? "A diagram is worth a thousand lines of code,"
// as they say, so one of those "spheres along the ray" visual aids would be helpful right about now. However, take my word that you can, at least, move
// the distance returned from the scene equation without overshooting your hit point. The reason being that you're guaranteed there's not a surface point
// along the ray that is closer... Even I'm starting to drift off at this point.

// If you're not familiar with the concept, then the above "explanation" might not be that helpful, so look the up process on the net. It's a lot easier
// to understand with the help of visual diagrams. For what it's worth, I think the algorithm itself explains the process better than a human can.

// Raymarching, or ray marching, if you prefer. The algorthmic version of the expression, "Am I there yet?" Between you and me, I know the guy who owns
// "Raymarching.com," and he has all the common sense of a rabid squirrel on methamphetamines, so if he can get his head around the concept, you shouldn't
// have any trouble.

        //
        // Anyway, belive it or not, the stop threshold is one of the most important values in your entire application. Smaller numbers are more
        // accurate, but can slow your program down - drastically, at u_times. Larger numbers can speed things up, but at the cost of aesthetics.
